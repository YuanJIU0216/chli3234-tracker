# Iteration and improvement part

* __feedback from tutor and Assessment 3__ For this Final Assessment, I almost refresh and iterate all the context and data model related to my assessment 3. 

* __1.The first one is data model question__ This images is my previous data model, but it's too board. Therefore tutor suggest me to narrow down the target audience futher to help justify further design choices. And also An online community and recommendations is beyond the scope of this task, so it's not necessary to include these goals. the data model should cover each data point for each item that the user inputs, it should not include the users personal details for something such as a profile as this information would only need to put in once.
